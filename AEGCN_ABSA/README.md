## Attentional-Encoding-based Graph Convolutional Cetwork

* Applied Sciences.
* It proposes the novel attentional-encoding-based graph convolutional network (AEGCN) model, which leverages the syntactic structure of a  sentence and utilizes multi-head self-attention combined with LSTM to capture context features and specific target features concurrently.
